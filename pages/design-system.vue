        This is a normal paragraph and heres a text example:
        <br>The Laje de Santos Marine State Park (Portuguese: Parque Estadual Marinho da Laje de Santos) is a state park in the state of São Paulo, Brazil.
        <br>It protects a marine area off the coast of the state, and was the first such park to be created by São Paulo. It includes a rocky islet, tidal reefs and surrounding waters, with various areas suitable for diving, including a boat that was deliberately wrecked to form an artificial reef. The combination of warm surface waters and cold deeper waters supports a high level of biodiversity.
